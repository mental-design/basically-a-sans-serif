Basically A Sans Serif
===
by Hyung-Suk Kim (Mental Design)

Basically A Sans Serif (BASS) is a monolinear geometric sans serif typeface primarily intended for display use. BASS comes in 9 weights from THIN to THICK. (ExtraBold and THICK are now official!)

BASS is the proportional version of Basically A Mono (BAM). Following the same principles as BAM, each glyph in BASS is constructed from lines, circular arcs, and elliptical arcs when necessary. In version 2, each glyph was revised to handle stroke contrast and additional components were introduced to improve typographic color.

BASS supports several OpenType features including SmallCaps(smcp), Unicase(unic), Tabular Numerics(tnum), Fractions(frac), and 3 Stylistic Sets (ss01/ss02/ss03), providing multiple stylistic options that allow for greater control and customization in your designs.

With the new features introduced in version 2, BASS has evolved from a simple typeface to a versatile typographic toolkit, ideal for your next geometric graphic design project.
